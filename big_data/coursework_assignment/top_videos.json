Fusion.\n\nSUPPORT THIS PROJECT: https://dream.shop/\n\nFollow my socials:\n\u27bd Twitter - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Instagram - @dreamwastaken\n\u27bd Snapchat - @dreampublic\n\nGeorge: @GeorgeNotFound \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/DreamWasTaken\n\nThere were tons of changes and improvements to the real-life-video-game fusion process, as you can probably tell by watching this video. I want to talk about it more in the future, maybe with a DreamXD video. There were tons of bugs in this video, and this recording took forever, so we decided to fix a lot of the bugs and record another one on George's channel, which should also be up now! In that video we added a health bar above their head, fixed a lot of issues including with vehicles, and overall made it cleaner.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for features, or any cool ideas for videos using this, let us know! We definitely plan on doing a good mix of videos with and without this tech. This was a ton of fun though, and was such an interesting way to experience Minecraft.\n\nThis is a Minecraft 1.20/1.21 challenge. This is not a Minecraft Manhunt video, but it is a Minecraft survival challenge, like \"Minecraft, But\". We use \"Fusion\", our real life technology, with some coding magic, to put real life people into video games. They can be seen in 3D in the world, and can interact with things using their hands, feet, and every part of their body. It's hilarious, a ton of fun, and the perfect way to merge real life and Minecraft. They can PVP, build, break, and survive!\n\nWe've spent a ton of time and effort on this project, so drop a like and subscribe if you want to show support :)",

        "description": "Fox Sports\u2019 lead College Football analyst Joel Klatt breaks down the huge upset in Columbus as Michigan beat Ohio State for the 4th straight year. He gives his reasons why the Wolverines continue to have the Buckeyes\u2019 number and why Ohio State\u2019s Offense was so conservative, resulting in just 10 points. Klatt discusses the lasting impact that this game will have on the programs going forward. He also gives his thoughts on the postgame fight on the field and how the emotions of college football rivalries are one of the best parts of the sport but can also, at times, go over the line. Klatt hits on the results around the country like Texas going to Kyle Field and winning at A&M before listing which teams are already in the College Football Playoff and who is on the bubble trying to sneak into the field.

        "title": "This Is The World's First Geared CVT and It Will Blow Your Mind -  Ratio Zero Transmission",
        "description": "https://www.ratiozero.com/\nSupport the channel by shopping through this link: https://amzn.to/3RIqU0u\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/d4a\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwosUnVH6AINmxtqkNJ3Fbg/join\nGrit: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3YSIPcvJsYbwGCDLNiIKA\n\nToday I have the privilege to hold in my hands something special. It is called Ratio Zero and it is the worlds first operational gear based cvt But before I explain how this piece of mechanical poetry actually works allow me to first explain why a gear based CVT is a big deal. \n\nAs you probably know CVT stands for continuously variable transmission and from the perspective of fuel efficiency, smoothness and ease of use they are the ultimate transmission. And while I would not choose a CVT transmission for a vehicle that I want to take to a twisty mountain road or to the track where I want to enjoy revving the engine out through the gears, I would gladly choose a CVT for a vehicle that I drive everyday on the highway or in boring stop-and go commuter traffic. \n\nA traditional manual or automatic transmission has a set number of gear ratios or speeds\n\nFor example, a gear ratio of 3.6:1 tells us that for every 3.6 revolution of the engine, the wheels only make one revolution while the torque at the wheels is increased 3.6 times. So the frist gear reduces vehicle but increases torque, this is why it\u2019s used for getting the vehicle moving from a standstill and top climb steep hills. \n\nA manual or automatic transmission will usually have anywhere between 4 to 8 such gear ratios which we call speeds. Compared to this a CVT will only have two \u201cgear ratios\u201d or speeds. This is because a cvt does not have gears Instead we have two conical pulleys and a belt or chain running around them. We slide the belt along these pulleys and the different sizes of the pulleys at different parts of the cone simulate an endless number of different gear sizes which means that a CVT has an endless number of ratios in this range between its lowest and highest ratio. So if an automatic or manual is a 6 speed or 7 speed or whatever than a CVT is a million speed transmission or an infinite number of speeds transmission. \n\nOk, if CVTs are so great why aren\u2019t they more popular? Why aren\u2019t they on every car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle? \n\nWell, that\u2019s because traditional CVTs, they kinda suck. \n\nTheir first problem is that although they help the engine be more efficient, they themselves are  not very efficient at all and that\u2019s because friction is at the very core of the design of a CVT. If you observe the inner workings you will see that torque is transferred between the pulleys by a belt or a chain. The belt or chain has nothing to grip onto, there are no gear teeth, no notches, no grabbing points, which means that the belt tension or the friction between the belt itself and the smooth surface of the pulley cone are the only thing transferring the torque. Which means that to transfer substantial amounts of torque we need substantial friction and as we know friction leads to efficiency losses, heat and wear. This is why a typical belt or chain CVT in a car is around 80-88% efficient, a more simple scooter CVT is around 70-75% efficient whereas a geared manual transmission is 95-97% efficient in almost all applications. \n\nThis is why researchers, inventors and many others have been trying to create a transmission that combines the smoothness, ease of use, fuel efficiency and continually variable gear ratios of the CVT with the torque capacity and low friction of a geared transmission.\n\nDespite repeated efforts there has been little success, until in 2016 a man named Edyson Pavlicu had a breakthrough idea - to split the rotation and create the world's  first geared CVT transmission  - Ratio Zero.\n\nA special thank you to my patrons:\nDaniel\nPeter Della Flora\nDave Westwood\nToma Marini\nZwoa Meda Beda\nvalqk\nCole Philips\nMarwan Hassan11\nRePeteAndMe\nSam Lutfi\n\n00:00 The Problem with Manuals and Automatics\n04:24 The Problem with Traditional CVTs\n08:03 Splitting The Rotation\n15:12 A Better Prototype",

A place where we can come together and talk about merch that not a whole lotta people care about. A place where we can do some fun crafts, and gain inspiration from each other!

Truly, truly, I want your suggestions, advice, and criticism on running this channel (don't be too shy to comment!).
