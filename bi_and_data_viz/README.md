# Competitive Analysis for UWE Bristol

This project involved developing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol)'s competitive position within the UK higher education landscape. The goal was to provide data-driven insights to inform marketing strategies and attract international students.

## Project Overview

This project addressed the need for UWE Bristol to understand its performance relative to competitor universities. By analyzing key metrics such as university rankings, scores, and career outcomes, the dashboard provides valuable information to inform strategic decision-making.

## Key Features

*   **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Data from the "Twelve Year Guardian League Table" dataset was cleaned and transformed using Power Query. This included handling errors, removing duplicates, and structuring the data for analysis.
*   **Data Modeling:** A robust data model was created in Power BI to establish relationships between different data tables (Subject Level Data, Institution Level Data, Competitor Institutions). A "Years" table was introduced to resolve many-to-many relationships, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** The Power BI dashboard features interactive line charts, cards, and slicers, allowing users to compare UWE's performance against individual competitors across different metrics and time periods (2011-2022).
*   **Stakeholder Focus:** The dashboard was designed with specific stakeholder concerns in mind, primarily focusing on the needs of UWE administrators and prospective international students. Research on factors influencing student university choices in the UK informed the selection of key metrics.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

*   Power BI
*   Power Query
*   DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
*   Data Cleaning and Transformation
*   Data Modeling
*   Data Visualization
*   Stakeholder Analysis

## Process and Methodology

1.  **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset in LibreOffice revealed the need for data cleaning and transformation.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Data was loaded into Power BI, and Power Query was used to address data quality issues.
3.  **Data Modeling:** A data model was created to establish relationships between tables and ensure accurate analysis.
4.  **Dashboard Development:** Interactive visualizations were developed in Power BI to address stakeholder concerns. Design principles such as Gestalt principles and preattentive attributes were considered for effective communication.
5.  **Stakeholder Feedback:** The dashboard was iteratively refined based on feedback and reflection.

## Key Findings

*   Analysis revealed that UWE performs better in certain metrics against shortlisted competitors, but faces stronger competition from universities on the longlist.
*   Employment outcomes were identified as a key area for potential improvement for UWE.

## Future Improvements

*   Incorporate annotations in the dashboard to highlight key differences between UWE and its competitors.
*   Explore subject-specific analysis to identify areas of strength and weakness within UWE's programs.
*   Conduct further research on international student preferences to refine marketing strategies.
*   Potentially use more advanced visualization techniques.
